## Amazing Dungeon <sup>(short for: Super Amazing OMG Dungeon Crawler 5000 Like So Great)</sup>

## What is this? (Project Description) 
This project is a dungeon crawler, utilizing a turn-based RPG battle system to get into battles with monsters while you try to make your way through the dungeon to get to the next floor and accumulate your score! Utilizing procedural generation to design every floor, you will (probably) never encounter the same level ever again. Use the randomly placed healing tiles and treasure chests on each floor to help you fight your way through the dungeon and break through.

## How to launch:
Prerequisites: [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)

1. Clone the repo in your terminal.
2. In terminal, navigate to the folder containing this repo.
3. Run this line in the root directory:  <br>
   ```$ javac Woo.java && java Woo```
   
Alternatively, if you want to see the layout of the map in its purest, realest, raw beauty, you may run the following in your terminal: <br>
```$ javac Debugger.java && java Debugger``` <br>
However, be aware this is not the intended method of playing the game and is mainly used if you are interested in viewing the inner workings of the project. There may be elements in the final Woo version that are not present in the Debugging version.
